MSCI ACWI LOW CARBON TARGET INDEX (GBP)

The  MSCI  ACWI  Low  Carbon  Target  Index  is  based  on  the  MSCI  ACWI  Index,  its  parent  index,  and  includes  large  and  mid-cap  stocks
across 23 Developed Markets (DM) and 23 Emerging Markets (EM) countries*. The Index is a benchmark for investors who wish to manage
potential risks associated with the transition to a low carbon economy. The index aims for a tracking error target of 0.3% (30 basis points)
while minimizing the carbon exposure. By overweighting companies with low carbon emissions (relative to sales) and those with low
potential carbon emissions (per dollar of market capitalization), the index reﬂects a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market.
It uses MSCI ESG CarbonMetrics data from MSCI ESG Research Inc.

The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index was launched on Sep 23, 2014. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index
existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
At each semi-annual index review, the MSCI Global Low Carbon Target Indexes are constructed using an optimization process that aims to
achieve replicability and investability, subject to the following optimization objective and constraints:

• Minimize the Carbon Exposure subject to a tracking error constraint of 30 basis points relative to the Parent Index
• The maximum weight of an index constituent will be restricted to 20 times its weight in the Parent Index
• The country weights in the MSCI Global Low Carbon Target Index will not deviate more than +/-2% from the country weights in the

Parent Index

• The sector weights in the MSCI Global Low Carbon Target Index will not deviate more than +/-2% from the sector weights in the Parent

Index, with the exception of the Energy Sector where no constraint is applied
