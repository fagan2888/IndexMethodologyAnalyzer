MSCI EUROPE LOW CARBON LEADERS INDEX
(USD)

The MSCI Europe Low Carbon Leaders Index is based on the MSCI Europe Index, its parent index, and includes large and mid-cap stocks
across 15 Developed Markets (DM) countries*. The index addresses two dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions and fossil fuel
reserves – providing clients with an eﬀective tool for limiting the exposure of their portfolios to carbon risk. By excluding companies with
the highest carbon emissions intensity and the largest owners of carbon reserves per dollar of market capitalization, the index aims to
achieve at least 50% reduction in its carbon footprint. The index also aims to maintain wide and consistent market exposure by minimizing
the tracking error relative to the MSCI Europe Index. The MSCI Global Low Carbon Leaders Indexes use MSCI ESG CarbonMetrics data
from MSCI ESG Research Inc.

The MSCI Europe Low Carbon Leaders Index was launched on Sep 16, 2014. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had
the index existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future
performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The methodology excludes the top 20% of companies based on carbon emissions intensity, with a maximum of 30% by weight from any sector.
It also excludes the largest owners of reserves per dollar of market capitalization, representing 50% of the reserves in the parent index. The
Index is optimized semi-annually to minimize the ex-ante tracking error to the benchmark, subject to the following constraints:

• Turnover: <10% semi-annually;
• Sector: <2% under- or over-weight; no constraint on Energy; and
• Country: <2% under- or over-weight.
