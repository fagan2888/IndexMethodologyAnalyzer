The MSCI Norway IMI 25/50 was launched on Oct 04, 2011. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI 25/50 Indexes take into account the investment limits required of regulated investment companies, or RICs, under the current US
Internal Revenue Code. One requirement of a RIC is that at the end of each quarter of its tax year no more than 25% of the value of the RIC's
assets may be invested in a single issuer and the sum of the weights of all issuers representing more than 5% of the fund should not exceed
50% of the fund’s total assets.

The MSCI 25/50 Index methodology aims to minimize index turnover, tracking error and extreme deviation from the parent index. The indexes
are rebalanced quarterly. Changes resulting from each rebalancing are made as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August
and November, coinciding with the quarterly index reviews of their parent indexes.
