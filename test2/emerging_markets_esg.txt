MSCI EMERGING MARKETS ESG SELECT INDEX
(USD)

The MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Select Index is based on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, its parent index, which includes large and
mid cap stocks across 23 Emerging Markets (EM) countries*. The Index is designed to maximize exposure to positive environmental,
social and governance (ESG) factors while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to those of the MSCI EM Index. The index is
constructed by selecting constituents from MSCI EM Index through an optimization process that aims to maximize exposure to ESG factors
for a target tracking error budget under certain constraints. The index is sector-diversiﬁed and targets companies with high ESG ratings
in each sector. Tobacco and Controversial Weapons companies are not eligible for inclusion.

The MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Select Index was launched on Apr 20, 2016. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period
had the index existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of
future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
MSCI ESG Select Index is constructed by selecting constituents from its underlying parent index through an optimization process that aims
to  maximize  exposure  to  ESG  factors  for  a  target  tracking  error  budget  under  certain  constraints.  Tobacco  and  Controversial  Weapons
companies are excluded from the index. Securities of companies involved in very severe business controversies are not eligible for inclusion.
Other exclusions include where companies do not have the controversy score or IVA rating or ESG score. Constituents are selected to maximize
exposure to higher ESG IVA scores, subject to maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to the parent index. ESG IVA scores are
normalized and factored into the optimization process. Further, the optimized portfolio is determined and the index is constructed using the
most recent release of the Barra Open Optimizer in combination with the relevant Barra Equity Model. The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly
basis coinciding with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes are eﬀective at the beginning of March,
June, September and December.
