MSCI GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT INDEX (USD)

The  MSCI  Global  Environment  Indexes  are  comprised  of  securities  of  companies  that  derive  at  least  50%  of  their  revenues  from
environmentally beneﬁcial products and services. The indexes are based on key environmental themes: Alternative Energy, Sustainable
Water, Green Building, Pollution Prevention or Clean Technology. The indexes aim to serve as benchmarks for investors seeking exposure
to  companies  whose  primary  source  of  revenues  increase  the  eﬃcient  use  of  scarce  natural  resources  or  mitigate  the  impact  of
environmental degradation. MSCI calculates the Global Environment Index and 5 thematic sub-indexes. Constituent selection is based on
data from MSCI ESG Research.

On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

The MSCI Global Environment Index was launched on Jan 20, 2009. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index
existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI Global Environment Indexes are drawn from the universe of the MSCI ACWI IMI (Investable Market Index), a broad market benchmark
of developed and emerging market large, mid and small cap securities. Securities of companies in the indexes derive at least 50% of their
revenues from products and services from Alternative Energy, Sustainable Water, Green Building, Pollution Prevention or Clean Technology.

The composition of the MSCI Global Environment Indexes is fully reviewed semi-annually in May and November. At each semi-annual index
review, eligible securities may be added to the MSCI Global Environment Indexes and an existing constituent may be deleted from the indexes
if they show declining involvement in one of the ﬁve environmental themes. In addition, the indexes are also reviewed in February and August
to reﬂect additions to and deletions from the MSCI ACWI IMI.

The Index utilizes ﬂoat-adjusted market capitalization weighting.  The changes to the MSCI Global Environment Indexes resulting from the
semi-annual and quarterly index reviews are eﬀective at the open of the ﬁrst business day of March, June, September and December.
