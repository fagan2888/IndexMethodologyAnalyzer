MSCI ACWI LOW CARBON LEADERS INDEX (EUR)

The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index is based on the MSCI ACWI Index, its parent index, and includes large and mid-cap stocks
across 23 Developed Markets (DM) and 23 Emerging Markets (EM) countries*. The index addresses two dimensions of carbon exposure –
carbon emissions and fossil fuel reserves – providing clients with an eﬀective tool for limiting the exposure of their portfolios to carbon
risk. By excluding companies with the highest carbon emissions intensity and the largest owners of carbon reserves per dollar of market
capitalization, the index aims to achieve at least 50% reduction in its carbon footprint. The index also aims to maintain wide and consistent
market exposure by minimizing the tracking error relative to the MSCI ACWI Index. The MSCI Global Low Carbon Leaders Indexes use
MSCI ESG CarbonMetrics data from MSCI ESG Research Inc.

The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index was launched on Sep 16, 2014. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index
existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The methodology excludes the top 20% of companies based on carbon emissions intensity, with a maximum of 30% by weight from any sector.
It also excludes the largest owners of reserves per dollar of market capitalization, representing 50% of the reserves in the parent index. The
Index is optimized semi-annually to minimize the ex-ante tracking error to the benchmark, subject to the following constraints:

• Turnover: <10% semi-annually;
• Sector: <2% under- or over-weight; no constraint on Energy; and
• Country: <2% under- or over-weight.
