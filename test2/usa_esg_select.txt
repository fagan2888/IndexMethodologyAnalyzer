MSCI USA ESG SELECT INDEX (USD)

exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to those of the MSCI USA Index. The Index is optimized to be sector diversiﬁed, targeting
companies with high ESG ratings in each sector. Relative to the MSCI USA Index, the MSCI USA ESG Select Index tends to over-weight

investment opportunity set with a very high ESG score and controlled risk. Constituent selection is based on data from MSCI ESG Research.

On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

The MSCI USA ESG Select Index was launched on Jun 01, 2004. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
MSCI USA ESG Select Index constituents are selected from the MSCI USA Index, which is made up of securities of large and mid cap U.S.
companies. Companies with Tobacco involvement are excluded from the Index. Companies with an Impact Monitor score below 3 are not
eligible for the Index. The universe of eligible companies are optimized using parameters for predicted tracking error (1.8%), maximum (5%)
and minimum (0.1%) constituent weight, sector variation from the parent index (+/-3%), turnover and other factors. Since constituent selection
and weights are determined using optimization, the Index is not capitalization weighted. At the Quarterly Index Reviews, companies with
Impact Monitor scores below 2 are removed. The Index is optimized on a quarterly basis coinciding with the regular Index Reviews of the
MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes are eﬀective at the beginning of March, June, September and December.
