On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

The MSCI USA ESG Index was launched on Jan 01, 2001. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes are constructed by applying a Best‐in‐Class selection process to companies in the regional indexes
that make up MSCI ACWI, a global equity index consisting of developed and emerging market countries.

The Global Sustainability Indexes target sector and region weights consistent with those of the underlying indexes to limit the systematic risk
introduced by the ESG selection process. The methodology aims to include securities of companies with the highest ESG ratings representing
50% of the market capitalization in each sector and region of the parent Index. Companies that are not existing constituents of The Global
Sustainability Indexes must have an MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above and an Impact Monitor score of 3 or above to be eligible. The selection
universe for The Global Sustainability Indexes is the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes.

The Index is ﬂoat-adjusted market capitalization weighted. The Annual Review of the MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes takes place in May,
and they are rebalanced in August, November and February.
