MSCI NORTH AMERICA LOW CARBON LEADERS
INDEX (USD)

The MSCI North America Low Carbon Leaders Index is based on the MSCI North America Index, its parent index, and includes large and
mid-cap stocks from the US and Canada equity markets. The index addresses two dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions
and fossil fuel reserves – providing clients with an eﬀective tool for limiting the exposure of their portfolios to carbon risk. By excluding
companies with the highest carbon emissions intensity and the largest owners of carbon reserves per dollar of market capitalization, the
index aims to achieve at least 50% reduction in its carbon footprint. The index also aims to maintain wide and consistent market exposure
by minimizing the tracking error relative to the MSCI North America Index. The MSCI Global Low Carbon Leaders Indexes use MSCI ESG
CarbonMetrics data from MSCI ESG Research Inc.

The MSCI North America Low Carbon Leaders Index was launched on Sep 16, 2014. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time
period had the index existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee
of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The methodology excludes the top 20% of companies based on carbon emissions intensity, with a maximum of 30% by weight from any sector.
It also excludes the largest owners of reserves per dollar of market capitalization, representing 50% of the reserves in the parent index. The
Index is optimized semi-annually to minimize the ex-ante tracking error to the benchmark, subject to the following constraints:

• Turnover: <10% semi-annually;
• Sector: <2% under- or over-weight; no constraint on Energy; and
• Country: <2% under- or over-weight.
