MSCI EUROPE SRI INDEX (USD)

The MSCI Europe SRI Index includes large and mid cap stocks across 15 Developed Markets (DM) countries in Europe*. The index is a
capitalization weighted index that provides exposure to companies with outstanding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings
and excludes companies whose products have negative social or environmental impacts. The Index is designed for investors seeking a
diversiﬁed Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) benchmark comprised of companies with strong sustainability proﬁles while avoiding
companies incompatible with values screens. Constituent selection is based on research provided by MSCI ESG Research.

On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

*  DM countries in Europe include: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.

The MSCI Europe SRI Index was launched on Jun 28, 2011. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI Global SRI Indexes are constructed by applying a combination of values based exclusions and a Best-in-Class selection process to companies in the regional indexes that

make up MSCI ACWI, a global equity index consisting of developed and emerging market countries. After securities of companies involved in Nuclear Power, Tobacco, Alcohol, Gambling,

Military Weapons, Civilian Firearms, GMOs and Adult Entertainment are excluded, MSCI’s Best‐in‐Class selection process is applied to the remaining eligible securities in the selection

universe.

The MSCI Global SRI Indexes target sector and region weights consistent with those of the underlying indexes to limit the systematic risk introduced by the ESG selection process. The

methodology aims to include the securities of companies with the highest ESG ratings making up 25% of the market capitalization in each sector and region of the parent indexes.

Companies that are not existing constituents of the MSCI Global SRI Indexes must have an MSCI ESG Rating of ‘A’ or above and an Impact Monitor score of 4 or above to be eligible.

Current constituents of the MSCI Global SRI Indexes must have an MSCI ESG Rating of BB or above and an Impact Monitor score of 2 or above to be eligible. The selection universe

for the MSCI Global SRI Indexes is the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. The Index is ﬂoat-adjusted market capitalization weighted. The Annual Review of the

MSCI Global SRI Indexes takes place in May, and they are rebalanced in August, November and February.
