The MSCI ACWI ex EMU Index was launched on Jan 01, 2001. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The index is based on the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes (GIMI) Methodology—a comprehensive and consistent approach to index
construction that allows for meaningful global views and cross regional comparisons across all market capitalization size, sector and style
segments and combinations. This methodology aims to provide exhaustive coverage of the relevant investment opportunity set with a strong
emphasis on index liquidity, investability and replicability. The index is reviewed quarterly—in February, May, August and November—with
the objective of reﬂecting change in the underlying equity markets in a timely manner, while limiting undue index turnover. During the May
and November semi-annual index reviews, the index is rebalanced and the large and mid capitalization cutoﬀ points are recalculated.
