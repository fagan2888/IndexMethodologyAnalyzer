On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

The MSCI Global Climate Index was launched on Jul 01, 2005. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI Global Climate Index is drawn from the universe of MSCI World IMI, a broad global benchmark of large, mid and small cap companies
across developed markets countries. The composition of the MSCI Global Climate Index is reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the
regular index reviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. At each Index Review, constituents may be removed from the MSCI Global
Climate Index due to declining company involvement in a speciﬁc theme. Companies that qualify for inclusion are added to bring the number
of constituents to 100. All the constituents in the index are restored to an equal weight (i.e., 1% for each constituent). Constituent weights
ﬂuctuate between Quarterly Index Reviews based on price performance.
