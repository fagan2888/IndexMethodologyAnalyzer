The MSCI Global Pollution Prevention Index was launched on Jan 20, 2009. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index
existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The Index is drawn from the universe of the MSCI ACWI IMI (Investable Market Index), a broad market benchmark of developed and emerging
market large, mid and small cap securities. Securities of companies in the indexes derive at least 50% of their revenues from products
and services in Alternative Energy, Sustainable Water, Green Building, Pollution Prevention or Clean Technology. The ﬁve sub-indexes are
aggregated to create the MSCI Global Environment Index. The composition of the Index is fully reviewed semi-annually in May and November.
At each Semi-Annual Review, eligible securities will be added to the Index and existing constituents may be deleted if they fall below the
50% of revenue threshold in one of the ﬁve environmental themes. In addition, the Index is also reviewed in February and August to reﬂect
additions to and deletions from the MSCI ACWI IMI. The Index utilizes ﬂoat-adjusted market capitalization weighting.  The changes to the Index
resulting from the Semi-Annual and Quarterly Index Reviews are eﬀective at the open of the ﬁrst business day of March, June, September
and December.
