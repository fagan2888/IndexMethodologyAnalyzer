The MSCI Sri Lanka Index was launched on Jan 01, 2001. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The index is based on the MSCI Global Investable Indexes (GIMI) Methodology—a comprehensive and consistent approach to index construction
that allows for meaningful global views and cross regional comparisons across all market capitalization size, sector and style segments and
combinations. This methodology aims to provide exhaustive coverage of the relevant investment opportunity set with a strong emphasis on
index liquidity, investability and replicability. The index is reviewed quarterly—in February, May, August and November—with the objective
of reﬂecting change in the underlying equity markets in a timely manner, while limiting undue index turnover. During the May and November
semi-annual index reviews, the index is rebalanced and the large and mid capitalization cutoﬀ points are recalculated.
