MSCI ACWI EX COAL INDEX (EUR)

The MSCI ACWI ex Coal Index is based on the MSCI ACWI Index, its parent index, and includes large and mid-cap stocks across 23 Developed
Markets (DM) and 23 Emerging Markets (EM) countries*. The index represents the performance of the broad market while excluding
companies that own coal reserves. It is a benchmark for investors who aim to eliminate coal reserves exposure from their investments due
to concerns about the contribution of these reserves to climate change. The Index is a member of the MSCI Global Fossil Fuels Exclusion
Index family.

The MSCI ACWI ex Coal Index was launched on Oct 16, 2014. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.
