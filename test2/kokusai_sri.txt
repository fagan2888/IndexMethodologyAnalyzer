The MSCI Kokusai Momentum Index was launched on Dec 11, 2013. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index
existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
A momentum value is determined for each stock in the MSCI parent index by combining the stock’s recent 12-month and 6-month local
price performance. This momentum value is then risk-adjusted to determine the stock’s momentum score. A ﬁxed number of securities with
the highest momentum scores are included in each MSCI Momentum Index, generally covering about 30% of the parent index market cap.
Constituents are weighted by the product of their momentum score and their market cap. Constituent weights for broad MSCI Momentum
Indexes are capped at 5%. The indexes are rebalanced semiannually; in addition, ad hoc rebalancing may occur, triggered by spikes in market
volatility.
