MSCI KLD 400 SOCIAL INDEX (USD)

The  MSCI  KLD  400  Social  Index  is  a  capitalization  weighted  index  of  400  US  securities  that  provides  exposure  to  companies  with
outstanding  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  ratings  and  excludes  companies  whose  products  have  negative  social  or
environmental impacts. The parent index is MSCI USA IMI, an equity index of large, mid and small cap companies. The Index is designed
for  investors  seeking  a  diversiﬁed  benchmark  comprised  of  companies  with  strong  sustainability  proﬁles  while  avoiding  companies
incompatible with values screens. Launched in May 1990 as the Domini 400 Social Index, it is one of the ﬁrst SRI indexes. Constituent
selection is based on data from MSCI ESG Research.

On September 1, 2010 the FTSE KLD indexes transitioned to the MSCI ESG Indexes. The former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have
been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources—sources which may have followed diﬀerent index calculation methodologies in some instances. The MSCI ESG Indexes
use ratings and other data supplied by MSCI ESG Research Inc, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.

The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index was launched on May 01, 1990. Data prior to the launch date is back-tested data (i.e. calculations of how the index might have performed over that time period had the index existed).
There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index is maintained in two stages. First, securities of companies involved in Nuclear Power, Tobacco, Alcohol,
Gambling, Military Weapons, Civilian Firearms, GMOs and Adult Entertainment are excluded. Then additions are made from the list of eligible
companies based on considerations of ESG performance, sector alignment and size representation. The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index is designed
to maintain similar sector weights as the MSCI USA Index and targets a minimum of 200 large and mid-cap constituents. Companies that are
not existing constituents of The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index must have an MSCI ESG Rating above 'BB' and an Impact Monitor Score greater
than 2 to be eligible. At each quarterly Index Review, constituents are deleted if they are deleted from the MSCI USA IMI Index, fail the exclusion
screens, or if their ESG ratings or scores fall below minimum standards. Additions are made to restore the number of constituents to 400. All
eligible securities of each issuer are included in the index, so the index may have more than 400 securities. The selection universe for the MSCI
KLD 400 Social Index are large, mid and small cap companies in the MSCI USA IMI Index. The Index is ﬂoat-adjusted market capitalization
weighted. It is rebalanced at the regular Semi-Annual and Quarterly Index Reviews in May, August, November and February.
