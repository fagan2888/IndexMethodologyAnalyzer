existed). There are frequently material diﬀerences between back-tested performance and actual results. Past performance -- whether actual or back-tested -- is no indication or guarantee of future performance.

INDEX METHODOLOGY
The MSCI ACWI ex Fossil Fuels Index is reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Semi‐Annual and Quarterly Index Reviews
of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. At index reviews, all companies in the underlying universe are reviewed for inclusion in the
MSCI ACWI ex Fossil Fuels Indexes. Any constituent identiﬁed as having fossil fuel reserves (proved & probable coal reserves, oil & natural
gas reserves) that are used for energy purposes is excluded. Any constituent that is deleted from the Parent index as a result of an index
review is also deleted from the MSCI ACWI ex Fossil Fuels Index.
